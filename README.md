# Cosa-NTP

This Cosa library is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol
(NTP) client; access time from server on network. Used for clock
synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched,
variable-latency data networks. Note: this implementation does not
adjust for clock drift or network latency.

# Install

To use this library you must download and install the [Arduino IDE] (http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (or
GCC AVR toolchain) and [Cosa] (https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa).

Download and unzip the Cosa-NTP library into your sketchbook
libraries directory. Rename from Cosa-NTP-master to NTP.

The NTP library and examples should be found in the Arduino IDE
File>Sketchbook menu. Open the CosaNTP example sketch. Select
the Cosa core by selecting one of the Cosa boards in the Tools>Board
menu.
